#logical operators are either "true or false" or "yes or no" or "0 or 1"
#equal to                           ==
#not equal to                       !=
#less than                          <
#greater than                       >
#less than and equal to             <=
#greater than and equal to          >=

#is 5 greater than 3?
# print(5>3)
# print(5<3)
# print(4==5)
# print(10==9+1)
# print(7<=22)
# print(6!=5-2)
